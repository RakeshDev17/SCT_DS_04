Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project: Accident Contributing Factors
Project Overview
This EDA project focuses on exploring and analyzing various factors that contribute to road accidents. Using a detailed dataset of accident records, the project aims to identify patterns, trends, and correlations to provide insights into the causes of accidents and inform strategies for improving road safety.

Objectives
Understand Data Structure: Analyze the datasetâ€™s structure, including variable types and distributions.
Identify Key Factors: Determine and investigate key factors influencing accident occurrences.
Detect Patterns and Trends: Identify temporal, spatial, and categorical patterns within the data.
Visualize Insights: Develop visualizations to effectively communicate findings and insights.
Data Sources
Traffic accident reports
Weather data
Road condition records
Vehicle and driver information
Key Factors Analyzed
Weather Conditions: Impact of weather conditions on accident frequency and severity.
Location: Geospatial analysis to identify hotspots and patterns in accident locations.
Vehicle:  Types of vehicles involved in accidents.
Accident Severity: Analysis of factors contributing to accident severity, including injuries and fatalities.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies in the dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Compute summary statistics to understand data characteristics.
Visualization: Create visualizations to explore relationships and patterns in the data.
Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between variables to uncover potential contributing factors.
Pattern Detection: Use clustering and other techniques to identify common accident scenarios.
Visualizations
Temporal Analysis: Line charts and histograms showing trends in accident frequency over time.
Weather Impact: Bar charts and box plots comparing accident rates under different weather conditions.
Geospatial Analysis: Heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize accident locations.
Driver and Vehicle Analysis: Comparative bar charts and histograms for driver demographics and vehicle types.
Severity Analysis: Stacked bar charts and scatter plots analyzing factors related to accident severity.
Key Findings
Temporal Patterns: Increased accident rates at certain times of the day and specific days of the week.
Weather Influence: Higher accident rates during adverse weather conditions such as rain or snow.
Location Hotspots: Identification of geographic areas and intersections with high accident frequencies.
Road Condition Impact: Higher accident rates associated with certain road types and conditions, including wet or icy roads.
Demographic Insights: Variation in accident rates based on driver age and gender.
Severity Correlations: Factors like speed and vehicle type contributing to higher accident severity.
